I will be staying in Defence Colony. We are keen to move back to Delhi from USA and hence are
keen to buy a flat in either Delhi or Gurgaon.Since I will be in Delhi for 3 weeks I am
writing to you in advance so we can make it a worthwhile trip.

I would be keen to look at a flat for ourselves- area of say 3500 sq feet and more, very
well located- good and quick access to New Delhi. I am looking at Emaar, DLF or Unitech only.
Price range of 2.40 to 2.5 cr.

Also I need to sell 1residential and 2 commercial properties as below:

I have an independent house in Palam Vihar -Gurgaon (by Ansals), which I am keen to sell.
The size of plot in Palam Vihar is 173.91 sq meters & the built up area is 1373 sq ft. address
is: PLOT NO C 2, BLOCK C2, facing a lawn and has a nursery on the side. Excellent
location - I should get at least 75L for it.

2 commercial properties in Jalandhar by DLF, I would like to sell them. This is a
construction-linked program and I have invested 43L in each property which is for 80L property. Area of each is 1608 sq feet and I should be able to sell it for at least 6100/sq feet. I bought it
